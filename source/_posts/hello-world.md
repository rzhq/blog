After spending so much time learning and forgetting. I’ve come to realize that I need to write things down.

There are mainly two benefits. One is to consolidate and organize the knowledge I’ve learned, the other is to practice my expression skills. I used to learn so many things and quickly forget about them because after I’ve gained the result I wouldn’t use the techniques anymore. Writing them down is a way to solidify the knowledge so that even if I’ve forgotten them all, it’s really easy to pick them up from my own words. Also after spending some time writing essays, it’s clear that I’m having a hard time putting my thoughts on paper. So a bit more practice wouldn’t hurt.

As I’ve already had opened and closed a couple of blogs before, I wouldn’t be surprised that this isn’t the last one. Well, who knows, hopefully, things will work out this time.
